--
-- The 'Ok' type is a simple error handler,  basically equivalent to
-- @Either [SomeException]@.   This type (without the list) was used to
-- handle conversion errors in early versions of postgresql-simple.
--
-- One of the primary reasons why this type  was introduced is that
-- @Either SomeException@ had not been provided an instance for 'Alternative',
-- and it would have been a bad idea to provide an orphaned instance for a
-- commonly-used type and typeclass included in @base@.
--
-- Extending the failure case to a list of 'SomeException's enables a
-- more sensible 'Alternative' instance definitions:   '<|>' concatenates
-- the list of exceptions when both cases fail,  and 'empty' is defined as
-- 'Errors []'.   Though '<|>' one could pick one of two exceptions, and
-- throw away the other,  and have 'empty' provide a generic exception,
-- this avoids cases where 'empty' overrides a more informative exception
-- and allows you to see all the different ways your computation has failed.
